# Agorakit 2.0 (very soon)

- Enhance usability and accessibility (need help)
- More documentation (need help)
- More locales (need help)

# Agorakit 3.0 (Q4 2024 - Q1 2025)

- Better integration (Embed, Ical, RSS) of all content including public calendar of events
- Web push notifications + UI to manage those per group / per user
- Bridge with collabora online / only office (WOPI) to allow online editing of docs
- Webdav access for the files if the above does not work OR integrate nextcould or similar file storage backend for groups
- Fediverse integration (minimal feature : allow Fediverse users to follow groups)

# Future of the project

- More complete Fediverse integration if there is demand
- Enhance the calendar features
- Allow groups to federate cross servers cross applications
- Your idea could be here :)
